Protecting gradients which connect low to high elevation habitats are thus essential to preserving future biodiversity. However, most of the world’s mountain ranges are narrowly protected and lack the elevational distributions needed to preserve biodiversity. We map the connectivity and protected status of elevational gradients from oceans to mountain ranges in mainland central america to reveal where connectivity between protected areas and important habitats is needed and may be optimized. To our knowledge this is the first synthesis of its type for this region. We also find clear differences in the degree to which lowland protected areas are connected to high elevation projected areas, which we believe will directly relate to how resilient they are to future climate change. Of the countries assessed, Panama contains the most connected climate corridors, largely due to the size and scale of the Darien Protected area. Costa Rica follows Panama, largely due to the importance of La Amistad protected area, a park where the climate corridors for 25 different lowland protected areas. Whilst other countries showed some potential for climate corridors, the quality of putative climate corridors in El Salvador were very low, largely due to the high degree of human modification in this region. We developed a prioritization scheme to select potential climate corridors for active restoration initiatives through considering starting protected area size, end protected area size, climate corridor length, quality and protected status. Resulting in the selection of 25 candidate corridors in ~10 distinct geographic locations. Finally, we developed cutting edge tools, grounded in circuit theory, to visual potential climate connectivity in central america in high resolution and apply this to 10 different regions. Finally, we advocate for the development of a novel ‘Climate Resilience Index’ to reflect each protected areas isolation from high elevation refugia. This index could be broadly applied within this study region and beyond. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that we cannot take for granted that the ranges of terrestrial mammals will be able to shift in responce to climate change. The majorty of our lowland protected areas are fairly remote from high elevation refugia, and considerable restoration work is required to address this issue. 1.2 Approach The approach we have taken in this report revolves around three key elements: to produce a fully interactive dosument where users can see and explore the underlying data to use state of the art remote sensing layers and methodologies to explore connectivity (e.g. Google Earth Engine) to provide actionable information for the design of corridors and directions of restoration activities It is important to note that all the assessments of connectivity here rely on habitat structural variables, rather than the movement or habitat selection of individual species, and should be interpreted as such. The surfaces will be most relevant to terrestrial, primary forest dwelling mammals. All of the data to reproduce the analysis and code in this report is stored, in this location. Email Chris Beirne for access. All of the underlying code and data will ultimately be available on GitHub. 1.3 Report structure The structure of the report follows the statement of work outlined in the research agreement: Assemble of data sets at the appropriate scale and resolution to be included in the connectivity analysis (see the data assembly chapter. Integrate remote sensed layers of habitat state and land-use into different cost surfaces (capturing barriers to wildlife movement) across the focal landscapes (see the resistance surface chapter. Run simulations exploring the degree of connectivity between specified low and high elevation protected areas (‘nodes’), using the different cost-surface scenarios (see the least cost paths and circuitscape chapters). Use the output of the models to identify key locations where land-use change or habitat restoration could enhance low-high elevation connectivity and overlaps with existing corridors / important areas (see the synthesis chapter). Finally, high resolution land use maps should be produced for conservation and restoration planning. This should be underpinned by the analysis outlined in this document. "],["data-assembly.html", "Chapter 2 Data assembly 2.1 Define the focal area 2.2 Data products 2.3 Start and end nodes", " Chapter 2 Data assembly The following chapter details how we determined the area of interest and where we acquired the data products to be used in the connectivity analyses. We include justification of data sources where appropriate. 2.1 Define the focal area This project focuses on the area covered by the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor MBC, which spans most of mainland central America. This excludes islands in central America and the Caribbean, as these will likely need a differing set of ridge-to-reef definitions. We also exclude Mexico. The full focal area spans: Below we show the exclusion of surrounding islands: For an up to date assessment of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor in Panama alone see: Meyer, N.

Movement ecology, 8(1), 1-14. 2.2 Data products 2.2.1 Protected areas Shape files for protected areas were downloaded from the Protected Planet database. The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most up-to-date and complete source of information on protected areas, updated monthly with submissions from governments, non-governmental organizations, landowners, and communities. It is managed by the United Nations Environment Programme’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) with support from IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA). We buffered the area of interest by 10km, then excluded any protected ares which fell outside of that zone. This means marine protected areas &gt;10km from the shore are not considered. There are two broad types of park - National and International designations - there are also many further subdivisions not considered here. As recommended in the WDPA best practices guide, we removed any PA that did not report its area, or with a ‘Proposed’ status or ‘UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserve’ designation (Note core areas remain under national park designations). Data source: UNEP-WCMC and IUCN (year), Protected Planet: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) [February 2022], Cambridge, UK: UNEP-WCMC and IUCN Available at: Protected Planet. And and all protected areas in an interactive version: 2.2.1.1 Types of protected area Within our focal area, the WPDA dataset includes the following number of terrestrial and marine protected areas: Type Freq Terrestrial 832 Marine 90 There are also a myriad of different protection designations: Type Freq Archaeological Reserve 11 Area de Manejo de Hábitat 1 Área de Manejo de Hábitat 6 Area de Manejo de Hábitat/Especies 7 Área de Manejo de Hábitat/Especies 1 Área de Protección de Flora y Fauna 2 Área de Protección y Restauración 7 Área de Recursos Manejados 2 Area de Uso Multiple 4 Area de Uso Múltiple 5 Área de Uso Múltiple 2 Área Destinada Voluntariamente a la Conservación 4 Area Marina de Manejo 2 Área Natural 4 Área Natural Protegida 53 Área Natural Protegida Privada 1 Área Productora de Agua 2 Área Protegida con Recursos Manejados 5 Área Recreativa 2 Área Silvestre 2 Biotopo Protegido 6 Bosque Protector 2 Burdon Canal Nature Reserve 1 Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary 1 Conservation Easement 1 Corredor Biológico 1 Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary 1 Forest Reserve 15 Hol Chan 1 Humedal 10 Jardín Botánico y Centro de Investigación 1 Labouring Creek Jaguar Corridor Wildlife Sanctuary 1 Mangrove Reserve 1 Monumento Cultural 4 Monumento Historico 1 Monumento Nacional 3 Monumento Natural 7 Monumento Natural Marino 1 Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve 1 National Park 15 Natural Monument 3 Nature Reserve 3 Nohoch Cheen Archaeological Reserve 1 Paisaje Protegido 4 Paisaje Terrestre Protegido 15 Parque Ecológico 1 Parque Nacional 92 Parque Nacional Marino 1 Parque Recreativo Natural Municipal 1 Parque Regional 1 Parque Regional Municipal 76 Parque Regional y Área Natural Recreativa 1 Port Honduras Marine Reserve 1 Private Reserve 8 Public Reserve 2 Ramsar Site, Wetland of International Importance 27 Refugio de Vida Silvestre 36 Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre 47 Reserva Antropológica y Forestal 1 Reserva Biologica 7 Reserva Biológica 13 Reserva Biósfera 2 Reserva de la Biosfera 8 Reserva de la Biósfera 4 Reserva de Recursos Genéticos 2 Reserva de Uso Multiple 1 Reserva Forestal 15 Reserva Forestal Municipal 2 Reserva Forestal Protectora de Manantiales 1 Reserva Hídrica 3 Reserva Hídrica y Forestal 1 Reserva Hidrológica 3 Reserva Natural 53 Reserva Natural Absoluta 1 Reserva Natural de la Sociedad Civil 3 Reserva Natural Privada 179 Reserva Protectora de Manantiales 1 Reservas Forestales Protectoras Nacionales 1 Reservas Naturales Privadas 13 Sin Categoría Definida 3 Sin definir 1 Sitio Ramsar, Humedal de Importancia Internacional 10 South Water Caye Marine Reserve 1 Wildlife Sanctuary 5 World Heritage Site (natural or mixed) 6 Zona de Protección Hidrológica 1 Zona de Reserva Ecológica 2 Zona de Veda Definitiva 29 Zona Protectora 30 Zona Sujeta a Conservación Ecológica 3 2.2.1.2 Marine protected areas We will also use marine protected areas as our connectivity start points (“focal nodes”). Note - not all of these protected areas are fully marine, some span land and sea. 2.2.2 Elevation We downloaded the elevation of the area of interest using SRTM Digital Elevation Data Version 4. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation dataset was originally produced to provide consistent, high-quality elevation data at near global scope. Data source: Jarvis, A., H.I. Reuter, A. Nelson, E. Guevara. 2008. Hole-filled SRTM for the globe Version 4, available from the CGIAR-CSI SRTM 90m Database. 2.2.3 Forest cover (current) To get a layer reflecting current forest cover we use the Hansen Global forest Change index. These reflect results from time-series analysis of Landsat images in characterizing global forest extent and change. This data is up to date until 2021! Possible future data incorporation: Current (and future) coarse vegetation types can also be obtained from this Baumbach, L., Warren, D. L., Yousefpour, R., &amp; Hanewinkel, M. (2021).

Forecasting the influence of conservation strategies on landscape connectivity. Conservation Biology 2.2.4 Forest biomass We obtained above ground biomass from Spawn, S.A., Sullivan, C.C., Lark, T.J. et al. Harmonized global maps of above and belowground biomass carbon density in the year 2010. Sci Data 7, 112 (2020). This dataset provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of above-ground and below-ground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300-m spatial resolution. The values represent above-ground living biomass carbon stock density of combined woody and herbaceous cover in 2010. This includes carbon stored in living plant tissues that are located above the earth’s surface (stems, bark, branches, twigs). This does not include leaf litter or coarse woody debris that were once attached to living plants but have since been deposited and are no longer living. 2.2.5 Forest height For forest height we use the global 2005 dataset representing global tree heights based on a fusion of spaceborne-lidar data (2005) from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and ancillary geospatial data. See Simard et al. (2011) for details. Simard, M., Pinto, N., Fisher, J., Baccini, A. 2011. Mapping forest canopy height globally with spaceborne lidar.

Data DOI: https://doi.org/10.34892/1411-w728 2.2.7 Human disturbance: To incorporate human disturbance into the connectivity analyses we use the global Human Modification dataset (gHM). This dataset provides a cumulative measure of human modification of terrestrial lands globally at 1 square-kilometer resolution. The gHM values range from 0.0-1.0 and are calculated by estimating the proportion of a given location (pixel) that is modified, the estimated intensity of modification associated with a given type of human modification or “stressor”. They mapped 5 major anthropogenic stressors circa 2016 were mapped using 13 individual datasets: human settlement (population density, built-up areas) agriculture (cropland, livestock) transportation (major, minor, and two-track roads; railroads) mining and energy production electrical infrastructure (power lines, nighttime lights) As such, this layer represents a great starting point to measure broad scale patterns in elevational gradient disturbances.

They then compare the “cooling potential” of these corridors through looking at the pairwise difference between temperatures between linkages. 2.2.8 Current land-use and habitat To capture land use, we are used the high resolution (10m) land cover map over Mexico and Central America created by ESA. The data are based on more than 2 years of Sentinel-2A and 2B observations from January 2016 to March 2018. 2.3 Start and end nodes The analysis presented in the following chapters depends on having a suite of meaning start locations “reef” (reflecting mangroves, coastal protected areas and marine protected areas) and end locations “ridges” (reflecting protected high elevation forest habitats). The following code outlines the candidate start and end locations. 2.3.1 Start nodes This is where the connectivity paths will start from: 2.3.1.1 Mangroves &gt;1km2 According to the USGS: Global Distribution of Mangroves dataset there are 19074 discrete mangrove patches across the study area. The vast majority of these, however, are small: The distribution of sizes (km2) is as follows: Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.00000 0.00178 0.00615 0.22850 0.02601 91.29884 Consequently, we only focus on large mangrove fragments (e.g. &gt; 1 square kilometers) as this represents the resolution of our input layer. We have merged fragments which are very close to one another (e.g. on opposite sides of the river). If we subset to just fragments greater than 1 km2, we have 495 fragments. The centroids of these “large mangrove” patches are distributed as follows: 2.3.1.2 Coastal Protected areas The distribution of coastal protected areas which overlap (i.e. are within 1km) the coast is as follows: Reading layer `Coastal_protected_areas&#39; from data source `C:\\Users\\cbeirne\\Dropbox\\GitHubProjects\\Connectivity_Project\\data\\spatial\\protected_areas\\Coastal_protected_areas.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; Simple feature collection with 111 features and 31 fields Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON Dimension: XY Bounding box: xmin: -92.3179 ymin: 7.188517 xmax: -77.15883 ymax: 18.55661 Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 So we have around 111 protected areas which are link ocean and land. Note this also includes near-shore marine PA’s. For each of these locations, it doesnt make sense to include the full protected area within these calculations as they sometimes run a long way inland (biasing connectivity estimates). The center points of the protected areas would not reflect reef or ocean connectivity. We therefore crop each of these protected areas to the zones within 1 km of the coast, and will use these as connectivity start points. Map of the protected areas with 1km of the coast: 2.3.2 End nodes End nodes represent where the connectivity paths will terminate. 2.3.2.1 High elevation protected areas When we are measuring Ridge to Reef connectivity - we need to define a height threshold that represents a meaningful transition in elevation. What should this height be? We have initiated the analysis using a 1500m threshold, but why not use 1000m? Where we draw the line potentially influences the availability of high elevation areas which animals can move to. Below we provide graphical representation of different height thresholds across the area of interest: Examples of studies in central America examining elevation gradients: Smith MA, Hallwachs W, Janzen DH (2014) Diversity and phylogenetic community structure of ants along a Costa Rican elevational gradient.

We will use high elevation (&gt;1500) protected areas as the “end” points for our connectivity analyses. 2.3.3 Existing corridors 2.3.3.1 Corridors according to CBM Data obtained from the Central American Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD) - indirectly through PhD researcher Ruchi Patel rdp20@psu.edu - based on her paper: Patel, R. (2021). Paper plans and possibility: A critical analysis of landscape conservation policy in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. Environmental Development, 37, 100600. The corridors span the following countries: Belize Costa Rica El Salvador Guatemala Honduras 288 560 1229 385 212 Mexico Nicaragua Panama Zona Froteriza 158 452 530 46 2.3.4 Other sources 2.3.4.1 Key Biodiversity Areas Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are sites of global significance for the conservation of biodiversity. Currently there are 15,524 KBAs acknowledged worldwide, and more are continue to be identified nationally using simple, globally standardised criteria and thresholds, based on biodiversity requiring safeguards at the site scale. There are 11 criteria organized into five categories, namely (1) threatened biodiversity, (2) geographically restricted biodiversity, (3) ecological integrity, (4) biological processes, and (5) irreplaceability. As the building blocks for designing the ecosystem, bottom-up approach and maintaining effective ecological networks, Key Biodiversity Areas are the starting point for landscape-level conservation planning. We will explore the intersection between our ridge-to-reef corridors and these designated areas. Costa Rica: SINAC http://www.sinac.go.cr/EN-US/correbiolo/Pages/default.aspx "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Connectivity 3.2 Probalistic approach", " Chapter 3 Methods We have a suite of different tools available for connectivity modelling. The following section is an actively updated workbook which trials these methods, summarizes them, and decides on the approach. In Chapters 4-6, we implement the models. 3.1 Connectivity There are two general approached to performing connectivity mapping. Firstly, a least-cost-path approach where we can use graph theory to solve the easiest path from point A to point B. This is a deterministic approach where you get the same result each time and one route with no error. The second approach uses electrical theory to apply a charge across and landscape and measure the resulting current. This is a probabilistic approach. Both approached require the input of a “cost surface” or “conductance surface” - a raster detailing the ease of movement. For more details, see below: 3.1.1 Least Cost Paths In a nutshell, Grainscape takes a landscape resistance surface, creates grains of connectivity and minimum planar graph models that can be used to calculate effective distances for landscape connectivity at multiple scales. We can also identify nodes through which we would like animals to move (e.g. starting point -&gt; reefs; end points -&gt; ridges).

Chubaty A, Galpern P, Doctolero S (2020). Grainscape: Landscape Connectivity, Habitat, and Protected Area Networks_. R package version 0.4.3, &lt;URL: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=grainscape&gt;. Example: Below shows a network of patches (cream colour) and resistances (other colours): We then take this network of patches and calculate the ‘MPG’- the Minimum Planer Graph = an efficient approximation of all possible pairwise connections between nodes. We currently assume that the costs are all 1 between patches, but this can be altered to incorporate a resistance surface. And then we can then visualize these associations: We can then impose a threshold to define which patches are “linked” strongly and which are not. First we must define how many “units” a given organism can move over, for example here we could use 250. The green lines denote “connected” patches for this organism, the black unconnected. The graph above shows that this species would see the landscape as 6 discrete units. Whilst this is superficially useful, it is not really what we are trying to achieve in this project. 3.1.1.1 Distance between nodes The reason why Grainscape was create was to create the following graph. It represents a model which: is aware of a spatially-explicit landscape incorporates the shape, size and configuration of two-dimensional node patches (e.g. protected areas) can handle continuous geographic variation (resistance) in the spaces between the nodes (i.e., the matrix) In a minimum planar graph (MPG) the matrix presents resistance to connectivity and influences the paths and therefore the lengths of the links. The shape, size and configuration of patches with respect to their neighbors that influences where on the patch perimeters these links begin and end. The value of using patch perimeters rather than centroids is that it potentially improves the estimation of the shortest paths among patches. There are many other options for types of analysis, but one of the things we can do is finding the shortest route between two patches. Finding the shortest path through the network from a source to a destination node and the length of that path is a useful prediction of the network model and has many applications. It gives an expected distance through the network, taking into account the modeled connectivity among nodes. 3.1.1.2 How we could use this framework We could use this framework to evaluate the least cost path between protected reef/coastline areas, up to the ‘nearest’ elevation park by distance. This would, initially at least, give use a candidate set of locations with which we can use “high” resolution models to evaluate at the local scale (see the Circuitscape section). 3.1.1.3 Costa Rica example To demonstrate the type of information we can get from a least cost paths approach we will use Costa Rica as a case study. First we input the data: Our area of interest is: We then import the protected areas and give them a lower resistance (1) the surrounding areas (2): We can then add in the human modification index, and adjust the conductance scores according to the levels of human modification (1000 = high conductance, 1 = low conductance). We can then use this to calculate the least cost path. We subsequently discovered that there are variety of packages to perform this calculation. All packages lean on ‘gdistance’ to implement least cost paths. A second package, which focuses on human movement, ‘leastcostpath’ also provides some useful functions. We can then pick two locations, one as a source node, the other as a destination. Lets compare two different cost surfaces, one which just has protected none protected (left) and one which incorporates HMI: Setup a start and end point thenn run the calculations and plot the resulting paths: As you can see the second example makes more “sense” from an animals perspective. We can also calculate the distance the line takes, for example for the protected/non-protected example it is 1268.4 km, and for the human modification index example it is 1539.1 km. We can now design a loop to run from source locations of interest, to end nodes of interest (see Chapter 5). 3.2 Probalistic approach One of the principal concerns with least cost paths is that they do not consider alternative routes to the one determined. To get around this we will use the ‘Circuitscape’ framework to create high resolution probabilistic maps. Circuitscape has rapidly become the most widely used connectivity analysis package in the world. It is used by numerous state, federal, and local agencies worldwide. The data output can be used for spatially explicit conservation planning. Circuitscape uses circuit theory to predict movements of animals and how these affect overall population connectivity. It equates the flow of animal movement across a heterogeneous landscapes to the flow of electrical current through a circuit. Using a “resistance surface” which reflects a map of habitats available to animals - neighboring grid cells are connected by resistors, whose level of resistance represents the friction of the landscape to animal movement (i.e., low resistance grid cells are most likely to be traversed, high resistance cells less likely). Circuitscape solves the optimum routes through these resistance surfaces in a probabilistic fashion. The output below shows the application of ‘circuitscape’ to model the connectivity of protected areas for tigers in an Indian province: "],["cost-surface.html", "Chapter 4 Resistance surface 4.1 Creating the resistance surface 4.2 High resolution raster re-classification", " Chapter 4 Resistance surface The most fundamental aspect of connectivity analyses is the ‘resistance surface’. Resistance surfaces are spatially-explicit raster data layers that assign a resistance value to landscape features which in theory reflects the degree to which the feature in question impedes or facilitates movement. With a robust and rigorous resistance surface, functional connectivity across the landscape can be assessed. However, one of the biggest challenges in connectivity mapping remains the designation of specific resistance values to landscape features. See Zeller et al. (2012) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-019-00870-3. 4.1 Creating the resistance surface For this approach to give meaningful and actionable output, we need to define resistance surfaces which reflect animal movement. We know that spatial scale is an important element of this - the higher the resolution of the map, the closer it can reflect reality. However, there exists a tradeoff, the higher the resolution, the higher the computational time. We will switch between scales depending on the the approach and the scale of inference we like. General, broad spatial scale analysis will be done at low resolution. When we want to study a specific location, we will do it in high resolution. See the reference below for consideration of spatial scale: Hernando A, Velázquez J, Valbuena R, et al (2017) Influence of the resolution of forest cover maps in evaluating fragmentation and connectivity to assess habitat conservation status. Ecol Indic 79:295–302. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.031 4.1.1 Step 1: Coarse resoluton The first step in the analysis is to simplify the total focal area to 10 priority landscapes - we simply want to quantify the distance to and relative disturbance along the route, of low elevation to high elevation areas. To do this we use a computationally rapid, least-costs paths approach (see Chapter 4 for a description). The backbone of this approach uses the human modification index, which represents a proxy for the structural connectivity across the focal landscapes, modified by whether the area is protected or not, and weather it has (on average) forest cover. The basis of this approach is the human modification index layer, which we have invert so that high values = low disturbance (green), and low values = high disturbance (orange/white): Now we bring in the forest cover layer to penalize non-forest areas. The Y-axis label denotes % forest cover. Now we take the product of conductance with forest cover, to get an integrated forest-disturbance surface at 1km resolution: This layer is now ready for least cost path modelling. 4.1.2 Step 2: High resolution landcover Although we have a 10m landcover layer available to us, it would have take weeks to run connecivity analyses, even for smaller locations. Consequently, I am presenting a raster which has been reduced by a factor of ten in every direction (x and y) resulting in a 100m resolution. After the prioritization steps in the least-cost-path chapter, we will take a subset of these candidate locations and explore them in high resolution. The high resolution map is created in the same was as the coarse scale map (above), however at a finer grain (100m vs. 1km) with land-use and habitat quality accounted for. The high resolution maps leans heavily on the land cover map of Central America created by ESA. In order to conceptulize the resistance of each of these layers it is important to understand their definitions See this link for full details and validation: Tree cover: Area with a tree canopy cover of more than 15% of the surface and higher than the shrub cover and the herbaceous cover. A tree is a woody perennial plant with a single, well-defined stem carrying a more-or-less defined crown (Ford-Robertson, 1971) and being at least 3m tall. Snow and/or ice, open water or built-up areas cover less than 50% of the surface. Shrub cover: area with an herbaceous cover of more than 15% of the surface and dominant with regards to the other vegetation types (higher canopy cover than the tree cover or the shrub cover). Herbaceous plants are defined as plants without persistent stem or shoots above ground and lacking definite firm structure (Scoggan, 1978). Crop land: The cropland corresponds to the annual cropland which is defined as a piece of land (&gt; 50% of the surface) that is sowed/planted and harvestable at least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date. The annual cropland produces a herbaceous cover and is sometimes combined with some tree or woody vegetation (less than 20% canopy cover). This definition is an adaptation of the ‘JECAM annual cropland class from a remote sensing perspective’ definition (JECAM, 2014). Sparce vegetation: The area where the sum of all vegetation canopy cover is less than 15%. Grassland: The area with an herbaceous cover of more than 15% of the surface and dominant with regards to the other vegetation types (higher canopy cover than the tree cover or the shrub cover). Herbaceous plants are defined as plants without persistent stem or shoots above ground and lacking definite firm structure (Scoggan, 1978). Snow and/or ice, open water or built-up areas cover less than 50% of the surface. Bare areas: Areas where the sum of all vegetation canopy cover is less than 4%. Included are bare rock areas, sands and deserts. Built-up areas: The class is composed of any type of areas with a predominant artificial surface (&gt; 50%): buildings, roads, airports, etc. The class also includes industrial areas, waste dump deposit and extraction sites. We can then integrate this high resolution land use map with other layers of interest to generate our cost surface. The following is a down-scaled map of the whole survey area. Lets zoom in and explore a location we know well. 4.1.2.1 Interactive map It works pretty well! But you can see that the main issue is that forest quality is not accounted for. The green area encompasses all sorts, from high biomass nice forest to plantations. REVIEW QUESTION how shall we account for forest quality? We could use the human modification index? Maybe the tree height layer… lets see how they look. One inescapable issue is that they are likely to be at a different resolution to the landcover data. 4.1.2.2 Adjusting forest conductance We can potentially account for forest quality using a suite of different layers: The human modification layer, forest height, forest biomass and forest cover. Below we can explore those options. The map below has stacked several rasters in order to directly compare them. Human modification: 1km resolution, data collected 2016 Forest height: 927m resolution, data collect 2005, published 2011 Biomass: 300m resolution, data collected 2010, published 2020 Forest cover: 30m, collected 2021, published 2022 Use the menu contained in the white box to view the different data layers. Summary of potential modifiers Exploring the layers above we can make some general conclusions: The human modification is mainly a copy of the landcover layer, so that will not be an effective forest quality modifer Forest height looks useful but it is at a very coarse scale. It is effectively the mean forest height over the cell, so it would account for “patch size” and isolation indirectly. But much better than the simple forest/non-forest layer. The global forest cover dataset, despite being a higher resolution than the other layers, does not appear very good at discriminating forest quality. The biomass looks effective, and it is more recent than the forest height layer. In conclusion, we will use biomass as the moderator for forest quality.The way we incorporate it is to create a raster whereby biomass scales linearly from 0-1 between 0 and 100 Mg C/ha, and all values &gt;100 Mg C/ha are also denoted as 1. We then take the product of the conductance layer with the scaled biomass layer, to give a final conductance surface which weights high quality (high biomass) forest as highly conductive to animal movement. 4.2 High resolution raster re-classification Now that we have a high resolution habitat map (accounting for forest quality), we need to turn that into a “conductance surface”. This means assigning values which relate the habitat to the probability of animal movement within and between it. Using traditional approaches this took a huge amount of computational time. However, we found a work around using the ‘terra’ package in R. This package uses clever computing to reduce the memory load of large rasters making high resolution mapping in R more scale-able. For our re-classification scheme we will use the following formula, based on work from other publications. The values should be viewed as the probability of use e.g. 1000 = very high probability of movement, 1 = very low: No data: 0 -&gt; NA Tree cover: 1 -&gt; 1000 [The best, will moderate with the tree height layer to account for quality] Shrub cover: 2 -&gt; 150 [some cover - mianly seems to be forest margins] Grassland: 3 -&gt; 50 [Pasture] Cropland: 4 -&gt; 60 [May have canopy cover, risky] Flooded vegetation: 5 -&gt; 20 [hard to move through] Sparse vegetation: 6 -&gt; 40 [Risky but useable] Bare areas: 7 -&gt; 10 [Risky but useable] Built up areas: 8 -&gt; NA [Urban areas are excluded as they have no functional connectivity] Snow and/or Ice: 9 -&gt; NA Open Water: 10 -&gt; 2 [Very low conductivity -&gt; last resort (100m resolution will represent large water bodies)] 4.2.1 High resolution case study: Osa Zooming in to a specific landscape allows us to map connectivity at much higher resolution. We will ultimately do this for all of the focal landscapes defined, however here we present a single example to check that the high resolution resistance classification scored defined above are reasonable. Below is the high resolution ‘resistance to movement’ map for the Osa Pennisula. Red areas denote areas with high resistance to movement whereas blue areas denote zones with very low resistance. This layer looks like a reasonable resistance surface, however mangroves are paying a big price for their small stature, and appear highly resistant to animal movement (as they are low biomass). We instead will give them a higher higher conductance score (800), which makes them more favorable to animal movement. The update map below shows the high resolution map for the Osa Peninsula, These resistances surfaces are used in subsequent chapters to perform the connectivity analyses. "],["lcp.html", "Chapter 5 Least-cost paths 5.1 ‘End’ Nodes 5.2 Protected area climate corridors 5.3 Mangrove climate corridors 5.4 Comparing protected area and mangrove climate corridors 5.5 Case study regions", " Chapter 5 Least-cost paths In this chapter we use the ‘least cost paths’ (a.k.a. LCP) methodology defined in Chapter 3 to define the path of least resistance from all coastal protected areas (larger than 1km2) in the focal region to their corresponding high elevation protected area. For each protected area (Section 1) and mangrove (Section 2), we calculate the LCP for the 10 nearest (by euclidean distance) high elevation protected areas, then select the path with the least resistance. We then explore several important properties of these paths between different countries (e.g. path length, mean resistance, total resistance, quality of forest on the path), in order to understand the spatial state of low-to-high elevation connectivity in central America. Finally, we devise a prioritization scheme to select candidate locations for habitat restoration initiatives. It is important to note that the LCP method does not fully characterize connectivity in a probabilistic fashion, but it is a tool which cn give us simple information to design prioritization schemes. For a more complete consideration of connectivity, see the next chapter. 5.1 ‘End’ Nodes We first start by defining a suite of end points (or nodes) - high elevation protected areas. To do this we import all of the high elevation protected area polygons defined in the data assembly section. As the LCP methods require points as targets, not polygons, we also randomly sample within the polygons to create a complete suite of “end nodes”. This means that there are multiple end points within larger protected areas. In the map below, all of the end points are shown as black points, and their corresponding protected area polygons in blue: In total, we have a suite (n = 620) of end points for the analyses. For each protected area, we find the 10 closest of each of these end points (euclidian distance) and calculate the least cost paths to them. 5.2 Protected area climate corridors We used the package ‘gDistance’ and the function ‘shortestPath’ to define the least-cost path from coastal protected areas larger than 1km2 in size to the ten nearest high elevation protected areas. Note, we use starting points adjacent to the ocean to fully encapsulate the ridge-to-reef gradients. The map below shows the shortest (by distance) path (back lines) for each of the coastal protected areas. The underlying raster layer shows the cost surface, with red areas being highly resistant to movement, and blue areas offering low resistance. 5.2.1 Least-cost-path characteristics In the following section we explore a suite of characteristics which would make an area a “good” candidate for restoration to preserve low to high elevation connectivity. The categories are as follows: large starting area: a sufficiently large starting area would ensure strong “supply” of animals, as larger areas have higher wildlife carrying capacities. large end area: a sufficiently large end location would ensure animals can actually persist in the location they arrive in again, as the carrying capacity for wildlife should be higher. Short least cost path: short paths will be cheaper to restore than long paths, both in terms of the amount of restoration required, but also in terms of the logistics of tree planting. Path which is already partially protected: in theory, if a path is fully protected from the start to the end, it will not need any investment in restoration. This might occur if the low elevation areas and high elevation target are within the same protected area. If this is the case, the elevation corridor should be safe from future development. Path is already of good quality: it may be the case that the path travels through unprotected areas which are high quality forests, these paths would be a high priority for future conservation and resoration initatives. -Path which doesnt cross multiple administrative borders: the more administrative boudaries (e.g. countries) a path traverses, the more logistically complex its protection and restoration will be. In the following section, we compare the LCP characteristics between different countries to get a general understanding of the state of ridge-to-reef connectivity. 5.2.1.1 Number of coastal protected areas available Understanding how many different potential source populations there re per country can give an idea of where might be appropriate to start conservation initiatives. The barplot below shows the number of coastal protected areas (&gt;1km2) by focal country. As you can see, Costa Rica has the largest number of coastal protected areas, followed by El Salvador then Panama. Belize has the least. 5.2.1.2 Starting protected area size Not all coastal protected areas are equal however, and some have the potential be be quite small. The plot below shows the distribution of start point protected areas by country. On average, Nicaragua has the largest coastal protected areas. Excluding the marine protected areas, the most substantial are Darien (Panama) and the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve in Honduras. 5.2.1.3 End protected area size Having large, protected, end point make the climate corridors more resilient to climate change. The graph below plots the area of end points by country. Panama’s Darien and Costa Rica’s La Amistad are the largest, high elevation, contiguous protected areas in central america. El Salvador, Guatemala and Belize lack large high elevation protected areas. 5.2.1.4 Multinational connectivity The plot below shows the number of jurisdictional boundarys the climate corridors pass through. Most start and end within the same country (~1). The only exception is Belize, which has no high elevation protected areas of its own. Thus, the paths typically cross into a neighboring country. 5.2.1.5 Least cost path lengths Short climate corridors will cost less to restore and maintain, longer corridors may be highly logistically complicated. The graph below shows the average LCP length, from start to finish for each corridor. Given the lack of high elevation areas within its borders, Belize has the longest corridors. Costa Rica has, on average, the shortest although Guatemala, Honduras and Panama are similar. 5.2.1.6 Average conductance Paths we on average, less resistant to animal movement will be more effect as they should be easier to move through. The plot below shows the breakdown by country. Panama appears to be the least disturbed (most conductive) landscape, whereas the habitats in El Salvador, on average, traverse some highly unsuitable habitats. 5.2.1.7 Least-suitable habitat It may be the case that the utility of a corridor is defined by the worst habitat within it. For example, the habitat is so poor that animals may not traverse it. We explored the minimum conductance of each climate corridor across the landscapes in the plot below. As expected, El Salvador performed very poorly owing to the landscape being highly human modified. Panamas worst scores were typiucally better than the average scores of most other countries. 5.2.1.8 Proportion of the path which is already protected Understanding the proportion of these climate corridors which are fully protected can give insight into how resilient they are in the future. The plot below shows the proportion of each of the corridors designated as protected by country. Remarkably only 3 of the putative corridors are fully protected to date. These are corridors which terminate in Parque Nacional Cerro Hoya, Panama and Nombre de Dios, Honduras. Panama has several other corridors which are highly protected - including Darien and Reverendo Padre Jesús Héctor Gallego Herrera. Costa Rica’s highest protected climate corridor terminates in the Area de Conservación Guanacaste. As expected, El Salvador, on average, has the least prtected climate corridors. Over 20 putative corrdiors have &lt;10% protection. 5.2.1.9 Proportion of forest cover Regardless of whether the climate corridors are protected or not, they may have a reasonable amount of forest cover. The plot below shows the average forest cover per climate corridor by country. Panama has the highest average climate corridor forest cover (~90%), followed by Nicaragua. As expected, El Salvador had the lowest average forest cover (~60%). 5.2.2 Multivariate corridor prioritization Given that there are multiple elements which must be balanced in order to prioritise locations for climate corridors (see above), one approach to integrating them is through the use of a principal component analysis (PCA). PCA’stake multiple input variables and decompose the correlated variation between them into “principal components” - which are essentially a mix of all the variables which load onto them. This allows users to simplify mutiple variables of interest into two or three interprtable axes. Below, we perform this analysis on the characteristics provided above. Ccorridor length, start area, proportion forested, end area, average habitat conductance, and proportion of protected forest and their loading directions are shown as black lines, individual corridors are shown as points colored by their terminal country. The graph shows that axis 1 is principally associated with increasing starting area size, forest quality and proportions protected as you move fromn left to right. Axis two is principally associated with path length, with climate corridors increasing in length from bottom to top. 5.2.2.1 The ‘sweet spot’ A sweet spot exists in the above plot which represents climate corridors which: are not fully protected, but also have some protection have large start and end locations are which are not to long are already situated in good habitat These criteria all represent locations where climate corridor restoration initiatives would be suitable and, crucially, achievable. Using a green polygon below, we highlight the suite of corridor which fit this description: Below we plot these 35 climate on a map to see if we can find a subset of wider landscapes which represent tartgets for climate corridor restoration. 5.2.3 Conclusions As you can see form the obove map, the selected climate corridors are principally located in Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras. There is not much potential for restoration of climate corridors in El Salvador, and to a lesser extent Nicaragua, Guatamal and Belize. The majority of corridors lie in and around La Amistad protected area, from both the Caribbean and Pacific directions, highlighting the importance of these regions. Panama is relatively under represented as it already possess climate corridors with a cool percentage of protection and which contain good forest. These should be considered targets for preservation, not restoration per se. 5.3 Mangrove climate corridors We now repeat this process for mangrove fragments, to see if there are locations where there may be co-benefits for mangroves and terrestrial protected areas: The graph below shows the LCPs (black lines) for all mangroves larger than 1km2 in size to high elevation protected areas (blue polygons): 5.3.1 Country characteristics As above, we will summarize the linkage between mangrove and high elevation protected areas 5.3.1.1 Number of mangroves fragments 5.3.1.2 Starting mangrove patch size Mangroves are typically small ~3km2, but they can be up to 130km2. 5.3.1.3 End protected area size 5.3.1.4 Multinational connectivity 5.3.1.5 Least cost path lengths Mangroves in Costa Rica have, on average, the shortest links to high elevation protected areas. Belize the longest. 5.3.1.6 Average conductance What is the range in average conductances? Remember, higher = better. El salvador and Guatemala in the worst shape. Least spread in Costa Rica. 5.3.1.7 Least-suitable habitat How about the worst habitat (lowest conductance) for each path? 5.3.1.8 Proportion of the path which is already protected How much of each least cost path is protected? 5.3.1.9 Proportion of forest cover 5.3.2 Multivariate summary As before (see above), we implement a PCA to reduce the suite of important characteristics into two principal axes of variation. 5.3.2.1 The ‘sweet spot’ A sweet spot should exist in the above plot: paths which are not fully protected, but also have some protection paths with large start and end locations paths which are not to long paths already situation in good habitat Lets plot these areas 151 on a map a see if we can identify 10 reasonable candidates areas for restoration: 5.4 Comparing protected area and mangrove climate corridors Areas where climate corridors for mangroves and protected areas overlap will provide co-benefits for habitat restoration and may help in the prioritization process. Below we map both sets of putative corridors, protected areas = “red” and Mangroves = “blue”, to determine if there is any evidence for overlap: 5.5 Case study regions Below we highlight the regions selected for the high resolution case studies in the following chapter. "],["circuitscape.html", "Chapter 6 Circuitscape 6.1 Methods 6.2 Electrical current flow (a.k.a. animal movement)", " Chapter 6 Circuitscape In this chapter we use ‘Circuitscape’, a package built on the concepts of circuit theory, in order to explore patterns in connectivity between lowland protected areas and high elevation habitats. In contrast to the previous ‘least cost paths’ chapter, Circuitscape allows us to build probabilistic maps of habitat connectivity which account for the wider landscape context, rather than simply “the best route” to a given destination. There are two import considerations when applying the Circuitscape approach: Given that the the surrounding landscape context is taken into account in the calculations, the issue of scale is very important: a coarse resolution map can give a very different result to a high resolution map High resolution maps take a huge amount of computational effort, and thus it is not possible to create a high resolution map of the whole study area. To account for these two issues we perform the analysis at two different spatial scales. Firstly, at a coarse scale encompassing the whole study area. Then secondly, we zoom into specific locations identified as important in the least cost paths chapter to give high resolution information of the state of ridge-to-reef connectivity, and the potential for climate corridors. 6.1 Methods The Circuitscape models are implemented in Julia, a platform which can process spatial data much more efficiently than R or Python. The input files are rasters, which in simple terms are three matrices of values which reflect the source points (and the electrical charge you are applying to them), destination points (and the strength of their draw) and the resistance surface (the degree to which each cell inhibits or promotes movement of charge). In our scenario the “sources” are the low elevation protected areas, the destination points are the high elevation protected areas, and the resistance surfaces are the quality of habitats between them. We can then measure connectivity in two ways: from the pattern of electrical current flow (i.e., animal movement probabilities) across the resistance-to-movement surface. This is the way we explore the data in this report. from the effective resistance of the circuit, measuring the degree to which the source node is isolated from the ground node. This is what is analysed in the second section. The ‘effective resistance’ represents a novel index which we have developed - the “Climate Resilience Index” - essentially a quantitative measure of how isolated protected areas are from future climate refugia. 6.2 Electrical current flow (a.k.a. animal movement) 6.2.1 Coarse scale (1km) 6.2.1.1 Current proportional to protected area size For our first analysis, we apply a charge relative to the size of each of the lowland protected areas - the larger the protected area the higher the electrical current applied. Current is free to move to any of the high elevation protected areas within the landscape. Isolated, small lowland protected areas will only contribute small amounts of charge. Large interconnected protected areas with contribute large amounts of charge. Below is the output from this analysis across the whole survey area. The colors denote the magnitude of current flow: blue = low current flow, yellow = high current flow. The black polygons represent the destination high elevation protected areas. The map reveals several key conclusions: The Caribbean coast his a much higher degree of current flow (connectivity) than the pacific coast. This is unsurprising as the protected areas on the Caribbean coast are typically larger, and less disturbed than on the Pacific coast (refer to the human modification maps and protected areas maps in Chapter 2. Not only is the absolute magnitude of current flow higher on the Caribbean coast, it is also less constrained - there are more available routes to animals and on the Pacific Coast. Contrast those patterns to the north west of the map in El Salvador and Guatemala - all of the charge is being funneled through one narrow corridor. This represents a bottleneck in animal movement. The patterns in current flow closely mirror the availability of high quality forest habitat. It is important to not that the exact flow of current should be treated with caution as the map resolution is very coarse. See below for a high resolution case study. 6.2.1.2 Equal current Although the above method is good to understand how the number of animals flows across the landscape, if we are directly interested in the paths themselves we can give each protected area the same amount of electrical current. We then more easily compare patterns at the landscape scale. 6.2.1.3 High elevation area importance A third way in which we can use Circuitscape to understand patterns in animal connectivity is the hold all of the source locations at a constant voltage, then quantify the amount of current each of the destination locations accrues. This will give an index of the “importance” of each high elevation protected area: the higher the score it accumulates the higher the number of lowland protected areas which are contributing charge towards it, and the more “important” the high elevation protected area to landscape scale climate resilience. This plot demonstrates that La Amistad receives input from a disproportionately high number of lowland protected areas. Other important protected areas are Sierra de las Minas in Guatamala, and Cordillera Volcanica Central in Costa Rica. 6.2.2 Fine scale (100m) The maps shown above are useful, but they are at a scale which is not amenable to making explicit management recommendations. The next step is to use a higher resolution cost surface, see Chapter 5. From earlier model tests we determined that we can run landscapes at 100m x 100m resolutions in two hours. 10 x 10m grids would take days. I now provide an example case study based on the Osa Peninsula region of the power of high resolution connectivity analyses. 6.2.2.1 Case Study 1: Osa Peninsula Here we use the high resolution resistance layer developed in Chapter 4 to quantify finescale patterns in connectivity within the Osa Peninsula. As in the central america wide example, each protected area contributes an electrical current proportion to the size of the park. Current is applied at the midpoint (rather than the protected area as a whole) to allow current to move naturally throughout the protected areas. As above, the colors denote the magnitude of current flow: blue = low current flow, yellow = high current flow. The above map shows two interesting elements: Firstly, it highlights the importance of protected and contiguous habitat in the neck of the peninsula, north of Corcovado. All routes must pass through here, hence the electrical current flow is relatively high. Secondly, despite the existence of existing “corridors” through the matrix of disturbed and human modified habitat between the peninsula and La Amistad to the north - there is no clear patch of least resistance. Cnnectivity appears to be highly diffuse and low across the whole region. This suggests that there is only weak functional connectivity between the Peninsula and La Amistad, and that climate resilience may be low. It is also import to check if connectivity map generated holds up local scales. An example plantation below suggests that the electric flow maps well on to how we would expect large terrestrial mammals to move through this system: Which suggests that such maps can be used to direct local restoration efforts aimed at improving ridge to reef connectivity in the region. 6.2.2.2 Case Study 2: Guanacaste This case study details the connections between Santa Rosa National Park and the highland areas of Volcan Cacao, Rincon de la Vieja and National Park Miravalles - Jorge Manuel Dengo. All of the highland areas have some degree of connectivity, however there is a very important corridor of connectivity (hot yellow in color) between Santa Rosa and the highlands of Volcan Cacao (see below). Much of this landscape is protected (to some degree), so this could be an example of a relatively “safe” climate corridor. 6.2.2.3 Case Study 3: San Pedro The “San Pedro” climate corridor links the highland Cerro Azul National Park and Cusuco National Park with lowland protected areas in Belize, Guatamala and Honduras. Although the path is relatively short, the human disturbance in the region in substantial. Combined with the fact that this landscape spans three administrative boundaries suggests with may be logistically complicated to establish an official corridor here. 6.2.2.4 Case Study 4: La Ceiba The La Ceiba region contains a relatively large protected highland area: Pico Bonito National Park. Although it is largely isolated from the lowland Refugio Vida Silvestre and Punta Izopa National Parks (separated by a large swath of highly disturbed habitat), it is connected to the coastal Nombre de Dios to the north. Nombre de Dios has some highland areas of its own, and thus represents a completely self-contained and protected climate corridor. 6.2.2.5 Case Study 5: Rio Platano The Rio Platano region boasts a great example of a potential climate corridor with some potential for habitat restoration. The large, coastal, Rio Platano Biosphere reserve is connected to high elevation areas in the El Carbon National Park. However, the path must negotiate a blanket of high disturbance around the river Ironia (see the hot white locations below). 6.2.2.6 Case Study 6: Indio Maiz This location has the potential to connect the lowland Indio Maiz Biological reserve [Nicaragua], Refugio Barro del Colorado [Costa Rica], and Tortuguero [Costa Rica], with the highland areas of Braulio Carrillo National Park, Cordillera Volcánica Central and Juan Castro Blanco. Viewing the map below, it is clear that there are two potential corridors, one linking Indio Maiz with Braulio Carrillo, and a second linking Tortugero with Cordillera Volcánica. Both corridors are incomplete, and pass through some highly disturbed areas. This is a great example of a landscape which could benefit from restoration. 6.2.2.7 Case Study 7: Limon In the Limon landscape, the relatively small Gandoca Manzanillo wildlife refuge and Humedal de San San Pond Sak are linked with the high elevation areas in La Amistad. The landscape is relatively well protected, aside from a thin strip of high disturbance around the border between Panama and Costa Rica. Given the trans boundary nature of this landscape, coordinating restoration initiatives may be tricky. 6.2.2.8 Case Study 8: Manglares In this landscape the Humedal de Importancia Internacional Damani-Guariviara lowland protected area is linked up to Reserva Forestal Fortuna, which is part of the La Amistad region. The corridor to the high elevation forest is not clear, and there is substantial human disturbance across the landscape. 6.2.2.9 Case Study 9: Sante Fe This case study location is interesting. The lowland park referred to is Donoso multiple use area, and the highlands it connects to are relatively small, near the Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos. It is interesting as the protected was proposed to be declassified in June 2022. As such, its status as a climate corridor is in question, particularly given the low protected status of multiple use areas. 6.2.2.10 Case Study 10: Los Santos The final location flagged as a potential climate corridor is fully encompassed in the Cerro Hoya National Park, Panama. As it is fully protected, it makes for a great example of an existing, protected, climate corridor. However the patch of high elevation forest itself is small. "],["synthesis.html", "Chapter 7 Synthesis 7.1 General conclusions 7.2 Important high elevation areas 7.3 Priority climate corridors 7.4 Unprotected high elevation (&gt;1500m) habitat? 7.5 Existing corridors 7.6 Future work", " Chapter 7 Synthesis This section synthesizes the information generated through the mapping exercise and the discussions which were had when presenting the results of this project. 7.1 General conclusions This modelling exercise has demonstrated that we cannot take for granted that the existing protected area network is resilient to future climate change. One of the fundamental assumptions prevalent in the current literature is that species ranges will shift to accommodate climate changed related alterations in thermal and moisture niches - typically moving up mountainsides to reach cooler, wetter locations. However, the majority of the parks assessed here showed substantial hurdles in the capacity for wildlife to respond to such changes. High elevation areas (&gt;1500m) are typically cutoff from their low elevation counterparts by substantial anthropogenic disturbance and unprotected habitats. This, however, is not always the case, several “gold standard” climate corridors exist which are 100% protect with good quality forest (notably in Panama), but these are the exception not the rule. 7.1.1 Country comparisons Given the findings of the least cost paths section, we find clear differences in the degree to which lowland protected areas are connected to high elevation projected areas. We believe these differences directly relate to how resilient protected areas are to future climate change. Of the countries assessed, Panama contains the most connected climate corridors, largely due to the size and scale of the Darien Protected area. Costa Rica follows Panama, principally due to the importance of La Amistad protected area, a park where the climate corridors connect for 25 different lowland protected areas. The quality of putative climate corridors in El Salvador were very low, largely due to the high degree of human modification in this region. Whilst other countries fell between the two extremes. 7.2 Important high elevation areas Circuitscape modelling revealed that La Amistad is a crucial high elevation end point for many of the putative climate corridors. This is likely owing to it being large, contiguous, and one of only a few options in Costa Rica and Panama. Other important areas include the complex of smaller high elevation protected areas in western Honduras (including Opalaca, El Jilguero and Celaque), and the larger Sierra de las Minas and Cuenca del Largo Atitlan in Guatamala. Robust management and expansion of these locations may be key to having a resilient protected areas system in the future. 7.3 Priority climate corridors We used a least-cost-paths approach to highlight ten broad geographic regions which would be beneficial targets for restoration of ridge to reef connectivity. These regions were spread throughout central American countries, however it was notable that there were non-selected in El Salvador, as the protected areas there are typically small and nested within a highly disturbed landscape. Circuitscape models revealed the variety of challenges facing restoration initiatives looking to connect lowland and highland habitats: lowland protected areas are typically surrounded by high degrees of human modification and poor quality (low biomass) forest. The three most promising locations for restoration, of the ten assessed, appear to be Osa Peninsula, Rio Platano and Indio Maiz - as they involve large lowland protected areas connecting to large upland areas across manageable distances. 7.4 Unprotected high elevation (&gt;1500m) habitat? In this exercise we only consider protected high elevation habitats. However, there is the potential for non-protected high elevation habitats to contribute to climate corridors. The plot below highlights the unprotected high elevation (&gt;1500m) forests (&gt;25 Mg C ha−1). We estimate that (1.26406^{4}) km2 of high elevation (&gt;1500m) forests are protected. However, substantial tracts of important forest remain unprotected (1.74358^{4}) km2, the vast majority of such forests lie in Guatemala and Honduras. There appears to be limited potential for high elevation protected area expansion outside of these counties, although some expansions may be possible around La Amistad (Costa Rica and Panama). 7.5 Existing corridors Given that we have identified putative climate corridors, it follows that we should ask if these corridors are already covered by existing/proposed corridors. Below we explore the overlay of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridors (MBCs) with those identified in this mapping exercise. 7.5.1 Least cost paths There is a certain degree of congruence between the least cost paths and the existing MBCs, however they are highly region and context specific. 7.5.2 Circuitscape As with the LCP’s, effective corridors should map onto regions with high current flow. This is not always the case, some corridors appear to be well represented, others less so. 7.5.3 Five great forests In 2021 WCS and partner organisations established the “Five Great Forests” initiative, which looked to protect five of the key remaining continuous forests in central america. The degree to which these forest contribute to climate resilience and the putative climate corridors varies by location: Darien: Darien is a large and well connected protected area that has its own high elevation patches. Consequently it is a fantastic example of a completely conserved climate corridor. All of the high elevation areas it connects to are already conserved. Not much else can be said about this region. La Amistad: Represents a critically important high elevation hub for many of the protected areas in Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua - the importance of La Amistad can not be overstated. Outside of La Amistad, there are several contiguous high elevation forests that are not yet protected, to expansion is possible. However, the size of La Amistad is already formidable. Considerable effort should be put in to connecting low elevation protected areas, such as Corcovado and Indio Maiz, to ensure that these landscapes are resilient to future climate change. Indio Maiz and Tortugero complex: As stated above, Indio Maiz’s path of least resistance is to La Amistad, it contains no high elevation regions of its own. This poses a key logistical challenge in that it spans the Nicaragua - Costa Rica Border. Tortugero has a second potential corridor, through the habitat around Universidad EARTH, however it passes through areas of high anthropogenic disturbance. Substantial investment connecting these two areas to La Amistad would be high beneficial for climate resilience. Moskitia: Moskitia has two tiny patches of high elevation forests within its borders, however these are not sufficient for true climate resilience. Examination of the circuitscape current flow suggest that animals will flow to the network of highland protected areas in Honduras. There are some putative wildlife corridors in the region, but none capture the flow dynamics predicted by circuitscape. The distances are also not trivial, spanning ~250 km. Establishing and protecting functional connectivity of the Moskitia complex of protected areas will be a considerable challenge. Selva Maya: The majority of this location lies outside of the current area of interest, thus the conclusions will not be robust. Future work should address the climate connectivity of this region. 7.5.4 Mangroves One of the initial aims of this project was do repeat the analysis we have completed for lowland protected areas for mangroves. However in the course of conducting and discussing this work it became clear that the link between mangroves and high elevation protected areas was not clear. Of greater importance to mangroves is the state of the watersheds which service them. Future work could explore the general disturbance of watershed servicing mangroves (red = high disturbance; blue = low disturbance). 7.6 Future work The following elements are beyond the scope of this exercise, however we propose that they be addressed in the future: Create an “Index of Climate Isolation” - a single value which represents the degree of separation from high elevation protected areas for all protected areas. This is possible with circuitscape - and is a considerable improvement on the least cost path approach (which only provides a cost for the single path). We currently only consider coastal protected areas as start points. Future work should expand this to all low elevation protected areas. Validation of current flows. This analysis assumes that the current flows calculated by circuitscape reflect animal movement flow, and we do not attempt to validate this assumption. It would be possible to validate these findings using camera traps of GPS collar locations, which would make the conclusions more robust. Current flow models and LCP’s do not account for terrain steepness, only habitat structure. If these models are to be applied to specific species (see above), ruggedness costs should be considered. The current analyses only include protected high elevation areas. This analysis should be repeated to include non-protected high elevation areas too. We currently do not account for how climates will change, rather we use elevation as a proxy for resilience. Future work could incorporate climate projections into the analyses.
